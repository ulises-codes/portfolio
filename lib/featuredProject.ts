    'u-znth is a low-latency synthesizer comprised of four oscillators. This project leverages Audio Worklets and Web Workers to ensure the UI remains responsive and uninterrupted. This project also leverages SharedArrayBuffer to speed up communication between the three JS threads. For an extra bit of fun, you can play the synthesizer with a MIDI Controller thanks to the WebMIDI API.',
