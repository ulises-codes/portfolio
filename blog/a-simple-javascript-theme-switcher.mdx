## A Subheading

Alternate UI themes (such as Dark Mode) have changed how web users can personalize their online experience, but they are also a way for you, the developer, to express yourself. But, where to begin? And how do you persist the user's choice even after they've closed the browser? While there are tons of UI and component libraries out there that can handle theming for you, often the best solution can be found with HTML, CSS, and some good ol' JS.

In this post we will look at a very simple theme switching solution using the [Local Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage). The Local Storage API allows you to easily save arbitrary data in key:value pairs in the browser cache. This means that the data persists unless the user clears their browser's cache.

```js
import something from 'somewhere'

const hello = something('parameter')

console.log('hi'.toUpperCase())
```
