## The callback function

Each one of these methods iterates over every element in an array, and calls a function supplied by you (the "callback" function). Each callback receives three arguments, the current element, the current index, and the array you are looping over. It looks like this:

```js
const callbackFunction = (currentElement, currentIndex, originalArr) => ...
```

## 1. forEach

[Array.forEach()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach) calls your callback function for each element in an array.

```js
const arr = [/* any number of elements */]

arr.forEach((element, index) => /* do anything, such as console.log the element */ )
```

Here's a comparison of how it would work with a regular loop vs. `forEach`:

```js
const arr = [
  /* any number of elements */
]

// A traditional loop
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  console.log(`Array element at index ${i}: ${arr[i]}`)
}

// The forEach method
arr.forEach((el, i) => console.log(`Array element at index ${i}: ${el}`))
```

You might be not be sold on `forEach` yet, but look at how quickly you can move now:

```js
const arr = [
  /* any number of elements */
]

arr.forEach(el => arr.push(el * 2))

arr.forEach(el => console.log(el))
```

Pretty cool, right?

## 2. filter

I find myself using this method regularly. [Array.filter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) will return a new array and takes a callback function which returns a boolean, indicating a particular element should be included in the new array.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1]

const newArr = arr.filter(el => el === 1)

console.log(newArr) // [1,1,1]
```

In the example above, the callback function only returns true if the element that has been passed as an argument is equal to 1.

You can even use this with an array of objects.

```js
const arr = [{ name: 'Bill' }, { name: 'Bob' }, { name: 'Buck' }]

const newArr = arr.filter(person => person.name === 'Bob')

console.log(newArr) // [{ name: 'Bob' }]

const anotherArr = arr.filter(person => person.name.length === 4)

console.log(anotherArr) // [{ name: 'Bill', name: 'Buck' }]
```

You can even chain this method, with itself or with other array methods.

```js
const arr = [{ name: 'Bill' }, { name: 'Bob' }, { name: 'Buck' }]

const newArr = arr
  .filter(person => person.name.length === 4)
  .filter(person => person.name[3] === 'l')

console.log(newArr) // [{ name: Bill }]
```

Yes, you can of course do this with just one call to `filter`, like so: `person.name.length === 4 && person.name[3] === 'l'`. I just wanted to show you what is possible, because you will likely want to chain methods together at some point in the future.

## 3. map

Possibly the one I use the most, [Array.map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) allows you to arbitrarily modify each element in an array, then returns the new elements in a new array. It's extremely useful and stops you from mutating the original array, which can lead to unexpected behaviors or errors in your application.

```js
const arr = [{ name: 'Bill' }, { name: 'Bob' }, { name: 'Buck' }]

const newArr = arr.map(person => person.name.split('').reverse().join(''))
console.log(newArr) // [ 'lliB', 'boB', 'kcuB' ]

const anotherArr = arr.map((person, i) => ({ name: person.name, index: i }))
console.log(anotherArr) // [ { name: 'Bill', index: 0 }, { name: 'Bob', index: 1 }, { name: 'Buck', index: 2 } ]
```

And, as I mentioned before, you can chain methods together.

```js
const arr = [{ name: 'Bill' }, { name: 'Bob' }, { name: 'Buck' }]

const newArr = arr
  .filter(person => person.name.length === 4)
  .map(person => `This person's name is ${person.name}`)
console.log(newArr) // [ "This person's name is Bill", "This person's name is Buck" ]
```

These three array methods are powerful tools to add to your dev toolkit. If you liked this post, please share it on the socials! Feel free to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UlisesHimely) or on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/ulises-h).
