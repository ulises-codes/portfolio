## TL;DR

[Here's the repository](https://github.com/ulises-codes/seven-simple-projects/tree/main/muziktron) if you just want to look at the code. Feel free to star it if you like it!

And here's a CodePen so you can see (and hear) what the final product looks like.

## A little background

I'm a musician and I love to experiment with music. Last year I built an entire synthesizer that can be played via MIDI controller on Google Chrome, [u-znth](https://uznth.live).
Any time my two passions collide, music and development, I'm like a kid in a candy store. So you can understand how thrilled I was when I discovered the [AudioContext](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext) api.

The `AudioContext` api is like having an entire live sound setup, complete with sound effects and everything. I've leveraged it a few times to create tones, like in a Simon clone I created called [Copy Me](https://copyme.fun).

Last year, I created a simple little sound generator I dubbed Muziktron, with the goal of writing a blog post tutorial. I never got around to it, but there's no time like the present, so here we go!

## Bootstrap the project

Our project will be written using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS. For the sake of transparency, note that I am using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to quickly bundle the files and serve them via a local server. Parcel is fast and I love it for little projects like these, but it's not a requirement for the project to work. As you can see the raw HTML, CSS, and JS in the CodePen work just fine.

If you follow this tutorial step-by-step, then your project directory will look something like this when we're done:

![Screenshot of directory in VSCode](ulises.codes/blog/how-to-create-a-sound-generator-with-vanilla-js/project-tree)

To get started, create a directory named **muziktron** and open it up. In your terminal, run `npm init -y muziktron` to initialize the project and create a **package.json** file.

Next, install the only external dependency, Parcel, via `npm i -D parcel-bundler`.

Then, add this script to **package.json**:

```json
// package.json
{
    ...

    "scripts": {
        "start": "parcel src/index.html --open 'Google Chrome'"
    }
}

```

Finally, create a directory called **src**, and then following three files (inside of src):

1. index.html
2. styles.css
3. logic.js

I intentionally named these files in a way that would help new developers understand how they each work together. In a typical project, each of these files would probably just be named index, as in index.js and index.css.

## The HTML

Our layout is pretty simple, basically an unordered list of eight elements, each one representing a note in a [major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale).

_Side note:_ If you don't know what a major scale is, think back to Do-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La-Ti-Do from elementary school music class, or the song [Do-Re-Mi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drnBMAEA3AM) from [The Sound of Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_of_Music). Phew, that's a lot of links.

Open up **index.html**. If you're using VSCode, you can bootstrap an HTML file very quickly by typing !, then tab or enter. This will populate some boilerplate, allowing you to focus on the `<body>` of your document. Either way, here is the full HTML markup, since there really isn't much to it:

```html
<!-- src/index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Muziktron</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <ul class="notes--ul">
      <li class="note--li">
        <button class="note--btn" data-key="a" data-midi-note="69">A</button>
      </li>
      <li class="note--li">
        <button class="note--btn" data-key="s" data-midi-note="71">B</button>
      </li>
      <li class="note--li">
        <button class="note--btn" data-key="d" data-midi-note="73">C#</button>
      </li>
      <li class="note--li">
        <button class="note--btn" data-key="f" data-midi-note="74">D</button>
      </li>
      <li class="note--li">
        <button class="note--btn" data-key="g" data-midi-note="76">E</button>
      </li>
      <li class="note--li">
        <button class="note--btn" data-key="h" data-midi-note="78">F#</button>
      </li>
      <li class="note--li">
        <button class="note--btn" data-key="j" data-midi-note="80">G#</button>
      </li>
      <li class="note--li">
        <button class="note--btn" data-key="k" data-midi-note="81">A</button>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <script src="./logic.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Note that we are importing the stylesheet inside of `<head>`, and our JavaScript at the end of our `<body>`.

Within each `<li>` element we have included a `<button>`. Each button has two data attributes, `data-key` and `data-midi-note`.

We'll use JavaScript to read each button's `data-key` to know which key on the user's keyboard should trigger that particular note.

Each `data-midi-note` corresponds to the musical note (or tone) that will be generated by our app.

## The CSS

There isn't much to note here, except that I used `:nth-child` so that notes would have the same color across octaves. If you'd like more of an explanation, feel free to hit me up on Twitter @uliseshimely.

}

.note--li:nth-child(7n + 7) {
  --color: rgba(200, 40, 255, 0.5);
}
```

## The JavaScript

Hey, you've made it to the fun part! Let's get going.

### MIDI to sound frequency

Remember that `data-midi-note` attribute? We're using the musical note's [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) equivalent because MIDI notes are sequential, and therefore easier to represent in code. Since a MIDI note is not a sound frequency, our application needs to know how to match the MIDI note to the frequency it should play. Let's create a file **src/helper.js** and define the following function:

```js
// src/helper.js
// https://medium.com/swinginc/playing-with-midi-in-javascript-b6999f2913c3
export function midiToFreq(midiNote) {
  const a = Math.pow(2, (midiNote - 69) / 12)

  return a * 440
}
```

### Getting started

Now we're ready to create our sound generator. Open **src/index.js**.

First, we need to import `midiToFreq`. Then, let's grab a list of all the note buttons that we defined in HTML.

We will also initialize `AudioCtx`, and define `frequency` and `oscillator`.

Note: `frequency` will represent the musical note, while `oscillator` represents the sound generator itself.

```js
// src/index.js
import { midiToFreq } from './helper'

const notes = document.querySelectorAll('.note--btn')

const audioCtx = new AudioContext()
let frequency
let oscillator
```

### Define the behavior

The sound generator needs to play a tone when a user either clicks or taps (on a touchscreen) on a button, or when the user presses one of the following keyboard keys:

`A S D F G H J K`

Oh, and we want the sound to stop when the user releases the key, stops clicking/tapping on a note, or moves the mouse out of a note button's bounds.

We are going to iterate over our list of note buttons, and add event listeners with the callback functions `startNote` or `endNote` (we will define these later).

The keyboard events fire at the window-level, so we'll attach event listeners to the window and add `handleKeyDown` and `handleKeyUp` as the callback functions (we'll also define these later).

```js
// src/index.js
...

notes.forEach(note => {
  note.addEventListener('touchstart', startNote)
  note.addEventListener('touchend', stopNote)

  note.addEventListener('mousedown', startNote)
  note.addEventListener('mouseup', stopNote)

  note.addEventListener('mouseout', stopNote)
})

window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown)
window.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp)
```

### The oscillator

An [oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_oscillator) is like a sound engine responsible for producing sound. We need to create a virtual oscillator whenever a note is pressed, and destroy that oscillator whenever a note is released.

```js
// src/index.js
...

function createOscillator(frequency) {
    oscillator = audioCtx.createOscillator()

    //   This is the type of sound wave we want to produce,
    //  See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OscillatorNode/type for options
    oscillator.type = 'square'

    // Start the note immediately
    oscillator.frequency.setValueAtTime(frequency, audioCtx.currentTime)

    // Send the audio to an output
    oscillator.connect(audioCtx.destination)

    oscillator.start()
}

function destroyOscillator() {
    // Only need to stop if there's actually a note playing
    if (oscillator) {
        oscillator.stop()

        oscillator = undefined
    }
}
```

### Handling playback

Ok so we can create an oscillator but we need to tell it what to do.

```js
// src/index.js
...

function startNote(e) {
    // Cancel mouse events to avoid clashes if the user is on a touchscreen
    if (e.type === 'touchstart' || e.type === 'touchend') {
        e.preventDefault()
    }

    // If a note is already playing, find the corresponding button and stop that note
    if (oscillator && frequency) {
        const activeButton = Array.from(notes).find(
            note => midiToFreq(note.dataset.midiNote) === frequency
        )

        stopNote({ target: activeButton })
    }

    // Get the MIDI note for the tone we want to play
    const { midiNote } = e.target.dataset

    // Convert the MIDI note to a frequency
    frequency = midiToFreq(midiNote)

    // Create an oscillator and pass the frequency to the oscillator
    createOscillator(frequency)

    // Set CSS class to 'active' for visual feedback
    e.target.classList.add('active')
}

function stopNote(e) {
    destroyOscillator()

    frequency = undefined

    e.target.classList.remove('active')
}
```

### Handling keyboard input

Keyboard events are a little different, so we will define two functions to wrap around `startNote` and `stopNote`.

```js
// src/index.js
...

function handleKeyDown(e) {
    // Find the button that corresponds to the keyboard key
    const button = Array.from(notes).find(note => note.dataset.key === e.key)

    if (button) {
        // If that note is already playing, return
        if (frequency === midiToFreq(button.dataset.midiNote)) {
            return
        }

        // Otherwise, play the note
        startNote({ target: button })
    }
}

function handleKeyUp(e) {
    // Find the button that corresponds to the keyboard key
    const button = Array.from(notes).find(note => note.dataset.key === e.key)

    // If the note is playing, stop that note
    if (button && frequency === midiToFreq(button.dataset.midiNote)) {
        stopNote({ target: button })
    }
}
```

## Run it

In your terminal, run `npm run parcel` and the project will build; you should now be able go to http://localhost:1234 and see it live!

Check out the `AudioContext` API to see how you can customize your sound generator even further.
