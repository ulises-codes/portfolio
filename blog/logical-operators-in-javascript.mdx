## TL;DR

I'm going to go over four logical operators in JavaScript.

1. Ternary operator
2. Logical AND (&&)
3. Logical OR (||)
4. Nullish Coalescing Operator (??)

## What are logical operators?

I like to think of logical operators as shorthand for if-else statements, except they can be used practically anywhere. Logical operators can shorten the amount of code you need to write, because they can be assigned directly to a variable, and because they eliminate the need for deeply-nested if-else statements. And, for good measure, they can also make your code very readable. Let's dig in.

## 1. Ternary Operator

The [Ternary Operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator) (also known as the Conditional Operator) is a relatively new feature of JavaScript. This operator allows you to write a complete if-else statement inline, and assign the resulting value to a variable (if you wish).

Here's a quick example:

```js
const numberOfPeople = 7

// Traditional way
let restaurant

if (numberOfPeople > 10) {
  restaurant = 'KFC'
} else {
  restaurant = 'Chick Fil A'
}

// With Ternary Operator
const restaurant = numberOfPeople > 10 ? 'KFC' : 'Chick Fil A'
```

### The Syntax

The left side of the statement is a condition that evaluates to either `true` or `false`.

- If the condition evaluates to `true`, then the operator will return the value that immediately follows the `?` symbol.
- If the condition evaluates to `false`, then the operator will return the value that immediately follows the `:` symbol.

You can read my example statement as "if the number of people is greater than 10, return 'KFC'; otherwise, return 'Chick Fil A'". I don't know why I chose that to be the example, because I'd choose Chick Fil A no matter what.

### Returns the value, you say?

That's right! Since the Ternary Operator implicitly returns its computed value, they can be used to compute a function's return value, and are a favorite when using arrow functions.

```js
const mealType = age => (age < 12 ? 'kids' : 'adult')

mealType(12) // Returns 'adult'
mealType(7) // Returns 'kids'
```

You can also explicitly return the statement in a traditional function, although you might be sacrificing readability if you do so:

```js
function mealType(age) {
  return age < 12 ? 'kids' : 'adult'
}
```

### Chaining Ternary Operators

You can add another Ternary Operator after the `:` symbol to chain statements together:

```js
const weight = 26

// Traditional way
let dogSize

if (weight < 24) {
  dogSize = 'small'
} else if (weight < 57) {
  dogSize = 'medium'
} else if (weight < 99) {
  dogSize = 'large'
} else {
  dogSize = 'giant'
}

// With chained Ternary Operators
const dogSize =
  weight < 24
    ? 'small'
    : weight < 57
    ? 'medium'
    : weight < 99
    ? 'large'
    : 'giant'

console.log(dogSize) // 'medium' since weight > 24 and weight < 57
```

Again, this may not be considered readable code in most circles, I'm just teaching you what's possible.

## Logical AND (&&)

You probably already know that the [Logical AND Operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND) evaluates to `true` when both conditions on either side of the operator are true.

Here's a very primitive example:

```js
const a = 1
const b = 9

const areBothLessThanTen = a < 10 && b < 10

console.log(areBothLessThanTen) // Prints 'true'
```

This operator is more sophisticated than that example, however.

When evaluating from left to right:

- If one of the conditions returns a [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy) value, then the operator bails and returns that falsy value. This makes sense, given that it checks to make sure that all conditions evaluate to true.
- If all the conditions are [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy), then the operator returns the last value. This is very handy if you want to arbitrarily assign a value only if all other values are true.

```js
// Some function to generate a ticket number
const generateTicketNumber = () => ...

const hasSignedPermissionSlip = true
const isAtLeastTwelve = true

// Traditional way
let ticketNumber

if (hasSignedPermissionSlip && isAtLeastTwelve) {
	ticketNumber = generateTicketNumber()
}

// Using the Logical AND Operator
const ticketNumber = hasSignedPermissionSlip && isAtLeastTwelve && generateTicketNumber()
```

## Logical OR (||)

The [Logical OR Operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_OR) is an extremely helpful piece of syntactic sugar that checks if either condition is `true`. If at least one of the conditions is `true`, then the operator returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

How is this useful? Let's say you need to assign a value to new variable `b`. You want to assign the value of variable `a` to `b`, but you don't know if `a` is actually going to have a truthy value (i.e., it might be undefined, null, an empty string, NaN, or 0). What you might choose to do is check if `a` exists, and if it doesn't, define a fallback value, like so:

```js
let a
let b

if (a) {
  b = a
} else {
  b = 10
}
```

That's great and dandy, but here's how you can do it using the Logical OR Operator:

```js
let a

let b = a || 10
```

That's just beautiful. The Logical OR Operator will return the first value if it is truthy, it returns the first value; otherwise, it will return the second.

## Nullish Coalescing (??)

My favorite of the logical operators, the [Nullish Coalescing Operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_operator) returns the left-hand side value if it is non-null; otherwise, it returns the second value.

The Nullish Coalescing Operator is similar to the Logical OR operator in that you can define a fallback value, except the fallback value can be falsy. This is super cool, because prior to this operator, we had to use inline Ternary Operators instead.

```js
let a

// The traditional way
let b

if (a) {
  b = a
} else {
  b = 0
}

// With a Ternary Operator
const b = a ? a : 0

// With Nullish Coalescing
const b = a ?? 0
```

It's also worth noting that, unlike `||` the left-hand side value can be falsy, it just can't be `null` or `undefined`.

- `0 ?? 10 // returns 10`
- `'' ?? 'awesome' // returns ''`
- `NaN ?? 10000 // returns NaN`

## Conclusion

There is more than one way to skin a cat, if that's what you want to do, I guess. So I hope this post helps!
