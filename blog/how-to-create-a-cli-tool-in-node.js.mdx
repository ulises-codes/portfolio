excerpt: "As a developer, I've learned that tooling can be just as helpful as learning a programming language's syntax. Abstracting away tasks behind a CLI tool can save you time, reduce the risk of errors, and can just be a great opportunity to learn something new. This post will help you create a basic CLI tool that does more than just print text out to the console."

## Introduction

Constant copying and pasting is a dangerous game, and can lead to headaches when trying to troubleshoot why your code isn't working. I should know, because I spent an hour trying to troubleshoot a markdown file yesterday, only to find out I had copied and pasted a string that opened with double quotes and ended with a single quote (read: face palm emoji).

So, I decided enough was enough; it was time to write a CLI tool that takes in some input and generates the boilerplate for new blog posts, spitting it all out as a markdown file. I've written CLI tools before (in Python and Node), but this one was meant to be a little different. Instead of taking one line of commands and then executing them, this tool had to be more like a series of questions and answers.

It took a bit of digging to figure out how to put it all together, and I hope this post saves you some time and adds a little value to your day.

## What I'll cover in this post

This post is going to teach you how to use Typescript and Node.js to write and run a simple yet powerful cli tool that will prompt a user for input, then write the user's responses to a file in the filesystem.

I will skip deploying it to NPM as there are plenty of other resources out there to help you with this. We will only use native modules since the built-in capabilities are robust and easy to use.

## Getting Started

Let's create a new project by running `yarn {or npm} init -y ./cli`. Feel free to replace "./cli" with whatever you want the directory's name to be.

Go ahead and `cd` into the directory, then open _package.json_. In _package.json_, set a name for this project: this is where you choose what the command will be named when you actually run it. Also set the bin field to the entry point for the cli.

```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "skynet",
  "bin": "./index.js"
}
```

If you're using yarn v3:

1. Run `yarn set version berry`
2. Install the vscode sdk by running `yarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks vscode`
3. Press cmd + shift + p, enter "typescript", then select "Select Typescript Version > Use workspace version".

Then, run `yarn add (or npm i) -D typescript @types/node`.

Next, create the file **index.ts** and open it up.

## Write the thing

Our goal is to create a markdown file which will serve as the starting point for a blog post. Our command will take two initial arguments, `create` and a directory where the file will be written. The user's response will the trigger the program to ask a series of questions that will be written to the file. In this example, our command will be `yarn skynet create ./blog`.

### Step 1: Get the arguments

Quick note: At the top of the file, make sure to add `#!/usr/bin/env node`. That way, if you run your tool with yarn (or npm), then yarn will call Node first prior to running the program.

In Node.js, arguments passed via the command line will be pushed into `process.argv`. There are two other arguments included in [process.argv](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/process.html#processargv), at indexes 0 and 1.

The first element, `process.argv[0]`, the [execPath](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/process.html#processexecpath), is the path to the Node binary on your system.

The second element, `process.argv[1]`, is the path to the file that triggered the program. In this case, that would be the path to index.js.

We don't need the first two arguments because we don't intend to use them, so let's cut those out:

```ts
// index.ts
#!/usr/bin/env node

const args = process.argv.slice(2)
```

Remember, our command is going to be `yarn skynet create ./blog`. So in `args`, the first argument will be **create** and the second will be **./blog**.

In this case, **skynet** will only handle one command, `create`. In the future we may want to add a `delete` command. Therefore, we will do two things:

1. Check which command was passed
2. Write a handler function for each command

This will keep our CLI tool modular and manageable.

```ts
// index.ts
#!/usr/bin/env node
import createBlogPost from './createBlogPost'

const args = process.argv.slice(2)

// Print a little welcome message
console.log("Welcome to Skynet. Let's get started.")

switch (args[0]) {
  case 'create':
    createBlogPost()

    break
}
```

### Step 2: Define createBlogPost

I found it useful to extract the logic for this function into a separate module and import it into **index.ts**. Let's create a new file, **createBlogPost.ts** and add the following:

```ts
// createBlogPost.ts
import * as Readline from 'readline'
import * as fs from 'fs'

interface NewPost {
  title: string
  author: string
  publishDate?: string
  synopsis: string
}

const formatDate = (date: Date) => {
  return date.toLocaleDateString('en-us', {
    day: '2-digit',
    month: '2-digit',
    year: 'numeric',
  })
}

export default function createBlogPost(outDir = './blog') {
  const answers: NewPost = {
    title: '',
    author: 'John Connor',
    publishDate: formatDate(new Date()),
    synopsis: '',
  }
}
```

For each new post that we create, we'll define the title, author, publish date, and a small synopsis.

Remember the second CLI argument, `./blog`? We want to pass that argument to `createBlogPost`, and we'll use it later when writing the markdown file to the system. This argument will be optional, however, so it's probably a good idea to add a default value to make sure the program knows where to write the file.

Then, inside the function definition for createBlogPost, define an object `answers` that will have some default values which can be overridden by the user's input.

### Step 3: Interrogate the user

Here comes the good part: we get to write the actual program. We are going to use Node's [readline](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html) module to read from and write to the console.

First, initialize the module using `Readline.createInterface(process.stdin, process.stdout)`.

Then, ask the user a question using `readline.question`, which takes two arguments: a string representing the question itself (the user will see this in the console), and a callback function denoting what should happen after the user responds.

In this example, we will ask the user four questions. In the callback for the final question, call `readline.close()` to terminate the process.

```ts
// createBlogPost.ts
...

export default function createBlogPost(outDir = './blog') {
    ...

    const readline = Readline.createInterface(process.stdin, process.stdout)

    readline.question('Title: ', title => {
        answers.title = title

        readline.question('Author: ', author => {
            answers.author = author

            readline.question('Publish Date: ', publishDate => {
                // Check if date is valid, don't care if it's in the past
                if (publishDate && new Date(publishDate)) {
                    answers.publishDate = formatDate(new Date(publishDate))
                }

                readline.question('Synopsis: ', synopsis => {
                    answers.synopsis = synopsis

                    readline.close()
                })
            })

            // Do this to display a default a value for 'Publish Date'
            readline.write(answers.publishDate)
        })

        // Do this to display a default value for 'Author'
        readline.write(answers.author)
    })
}
```

### Step 4: Spit it out to the filesystem

Finally, we write the file to the system. Right before your call to `readline.close()`, we do the following:

```ts
// createBlogPost.ts
...

// Auto-generate a filename based on the blog post's title
const filename = answers.title.toLowerCase().replace(/ /g, '-')

// Since we're writing to an mdx file, this metadata will be included in a yaml-style
// header, which is opened with '---'
let fileContents = '---\n'

for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(answers)) {
    fileContents += `${key}: "${value}"\n`
}

// Close the header
fileContents += '---'

// Create the directory if it doesn't exist
fs.mkdirSync(outDir, { recursive: true })

// Write the file
fs.writeFileSync(`${outDir}/${filename}.mdx`, fileContents)

...
```

`

## Compile Typescript to JavaScript

If you followed along with Typescript, then you probably already know that these files need to be compiled to JavaScript before we can run anything via Node.

Add the following script to your package.json:

```json
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
        "build": "tsc ./index.ts --esModuleInterop --skipLibCheck --moduleResolution node"
    }
}
```

Then, run `yarn (or npm run) build`, which will generate a compiled index.js in your project root that can now be run via Node.

Now you can finally run the command:

```sh
yarn skynet create ./blog
```

And voila! You should now be able to create new blog posts (or any other file) using a CLI tool, without copying and pasting boilerplate each time.

It's nice to be a developer.
