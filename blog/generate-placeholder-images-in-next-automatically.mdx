## What I'll Cover in this Post

TL;DR: A very small function to automatically create a Base64 blurred placeholder image, which can then be passed on to the Next/Image component.

My approach handles external images, such as images from Cloudinary.

Assuming you've already set up Cloudinary as your [image loader](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#loader-configuration), then this is all you need:

```ts
import Image from 'next/image'
import type { GetStaticProps } from 'next'

const imgToBase64 = async (url: string): Promise<string> => {
  const img = await fetch(url)

  const buffer = await img.arrayBuffer()

  const prefix = 'data:text/plain;base64,'

  // btoa is only available client-side, so check if that's an option first
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    return prefix + btoa(String.fromCharCode(...new Uint8Array(buffer)))
  }

  return prefix + Buffer.from(buffer).toString('base64')
}

export default function SomePageComponent({ placeholderImg }: { placeholderImg: string }) {

  return (
      <Image
        src={url}
        width={...}
        height={...}
        placeholder="blur"
        blurDataURL={placeholderImg}
      />
  )
}

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async () => {
  // The image's path in Cloudinary or the full url if it's coming from somewhere else
  const imgPath = "some_img_url"

  // I'm using Cloudinary here to blur the image
   const placeholderImg = await imgToBase64(
    `${process.env.CLOUDINARY_PREFIX}f_auto,e_blur:100,w_10/${url}`
  )

  return {
    props: { placeholderImg }
  }
}
```

## The Explanation, If You're Still Here

Let's break this down into a few steps:

Within getStaticProps, we need to:

1. Fetch a low-quality blurred version of the image to use as a placeholder.
2. Convert that image to a base64 string.
3. Pass the base64 string to your page via props so that the placeholder image is available at build time.
4. Rinse and repeat as needed.

## Some Gotchas

I've noticed that when using `priority={true}` on the Image component, that the image itself is loaded by the browser before the placeholder itself. I think that's the intended behavior; still, be aware that you probably won't see the placeholder when using the priority property.
